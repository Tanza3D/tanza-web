# tanza-web
This is my personal website, accessable at https://tanza.work and https://tanza.me!

## why two?
tanza.work is a more professional portfolio site for myself, it hides the art gallery, uses a more flat and professional design, and a different homepage to introduce myself as someone who you should definitely hire! - tanza.me on the other hand is my more personal one, more just speaking as my online self (instead of the person you should hire i'm good i promise!) and also shows off my 3d art which im proud enough to show but not proud enough to put up as a selling point to people

since they both show the portfolio and projects page, it was common sence to just combine the two and serve a different homepage and some changes based on the domain or not.

## can i contribute?
probably not? it's my personal site and i wouldn't be too willing to take in any large UI changes or such, cleaner backend would be nice but i really don't mind how it is now haha

## can i use the code?
go ahead! just... make sure you don't accidentally impersonate me along the way hey
